<br><br><br>PhotoLab is a minimalist collage creator that generates a collage of photos you input. I created it simply because I like how collages look, and thought it was a cool project to share with others! If you would like to try it out, you can go to [https://squirrr.github.io/photo-lab/](https://squirrr.github.io/photo-lab/) and add your images. The website works on mobile and desktop, and has 12 filters to choose from.
