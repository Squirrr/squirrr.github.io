Mantik is a website I created that trains students in FIRST® Robotics programming concepts, ranging from basic motor to advanced command-based libraries and control theory. By combining the documentation of a variety of sources, from the official WPILib documentation to each vendor's specific APIs, I was able to leverage AI to create accurate, concise tutorials for these complex concepts, which I published to my team as well as others. In addition, I created a series of video tutorials aimed at guiding students through these difficult concepts. The video tutorials are accompanied by pages on the Mantik website ([https://mantik.netlify.app/](https://mantik.netlify.app/)) so students have options. I also created a series of videos where students can simulate real robotics mechanisms and learn how to tune PID and Motion Profiles by following my tutorials, improving their skills while introducing them to complex features simultaneously.
