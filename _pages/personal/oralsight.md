title: OralSight - Conrad Challenge
permalink: /personal/oralsight/
---
OralSight utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify common symptoms of oral cancers and periodontal diseases. Unlike competitors, OralSight non-invasively scans the patient's oral cavity using specialized cameras that account for distortion, providing physicians with an accurate potential diagnosis. Additionally, we will continuously improve our machine learning algorithm through clinical partnerships where physicians provide HIPAA-compliant training data and utilize federated machine learning to protect patient data.
