OARobotics is an open-source project created by myself that hopes to expand FIRST® to less privileged groups. Originally, it started as an avenue for refugee students to learn about robotics in an intuitive and simple manner, but has since expanded to include tutorials without words for not only those who might not speak English, but also those with disabilities who may struggle to build and code the base FIRST® LEGO® League robots.

In addition, I have made a playlist of videos guiding students through the build process, which have been tested and verified to work with mentor supervision. Since the robot is not terribly complicated, I would advise mentors (whether children or parents) to follow the videos before going through them with the students if you have little experience with robotics. (If you are watching the video, you can click on the link title or on the playlist icon to find the rest of the playlist).

I have also designed a series of programming lessons using the base bot and their respective extensions, which I hope to upload soon (I am still working on them, and hope to get them done before the end of October).
