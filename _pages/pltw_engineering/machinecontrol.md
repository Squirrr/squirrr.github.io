<b>Objective</b>: We had to utilize our knowledge of VEX V5 components and programming to design and code a working machine based on a set of criteria and constraints given to us.

<b>Learning Target</b>: Students will build a machine from VEX components to solve a realistic engineering problem, completing the full design process from defining the problem to presenting the solution.

<b>Reflection</b>: I learned how to research and brainstorm an effective design, implement that design using CAD design software, create a detailed BOM for ease of assembly, efficiently program an elevator that meets the design criteria, program an elevator using a proportional controller, and display telemetry that effectively communicates the status of the elevator, and communicate with my team members to ensure our project stayed on schedule.
