<b>Objective</b>: Our design statement was to brainstorm, research, design, construct, and test a motorized toy car that teaches students different mechanisms in an engaging manner.

<b>Learned Skills</b>: I learned how to work past struggles I faced while designing a product, collaborate with team members to generate effective solutions and seek help from others when needed.

<b>Reflection</b>: Something I could improve on is maintaining a growth mindset when faced with problems. There were multiple instances during the construct and test phase of the design process where I became frustrated with the design and could not overcome my emotions in order to find an implementable solution to the problem. However, through patience and dedication, I was able to manipulate my emotions into a passion to find and create a solution to the problem. Eventually, I found a solution to the problem and succeeded in eliminating alignment issues with my car to enable it to run straight.
