While I joined my First Robotics Competition (FRC) team late in the season, I was still able to gain valuable experience in programming and designing a robot for the 2024 FRC Game, CRESCENDO. In this game, robots were meant to shoot rings into a goal, which required a combination of precision and accuracy in order to shoot from distances as far as 13.5 feet away!

During this offseason time after the season, I programmed one of the competition robots from scratch with little help from mentors. I learned motion profiling, status LED control, command-based programming, AprilTag and vision alignment, and pathing algorithms to contol the robot autonomously during the match.
