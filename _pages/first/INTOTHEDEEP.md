In this season of FIRSTÂ® Tech Challenge (FTC), I programmed a robot with no prior help and designed a custom pathing algorithm to fit the challenge. I was able to use my knowledge of Java from my offseason training to modularize the code into subsystems and coordinate multiple actions in parallel, taking our team all the way to our League's Tournament.
