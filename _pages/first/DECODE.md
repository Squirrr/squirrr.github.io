In this season of FIRST® Tech Challenge (FTC), I worked with my team to create a robust robot that could shoot game objects from across the field realiably. Using a dynamic lookup table, I could calculate the necessary speed and angle of the ball's flight path using distance data from the Limelight camera on our robot. Additionally, I used a Bezier pathing algorithm to create quick, consistent autonomous routines. Moreover, I created a custom localizer that fused dead-reckoning wheel odometry with vision pose estimation using Kalman filters to improve the consistency of our autonomous routines.

This season also came with many individual and team accolades. We reached the furthest we ever have in an event at the McKinney Qualifier, defeating the world-record holding alliance in the world at the time! I was also chosen as a Dean's List Semifinalist, with more updates to come.
