Welcome to my engineering portfolio! My name is Abdullah Khaled, and I am currently a junior at Wakeland High School in Frisco, TX. I enjoy both the hardware and software side of engineering and am always searching for ways to dive deeper into the field of engineering while helping others along the way. I am especially interested in robotics and how best to integrate the knowledge I have—from CAD to vision to sensor fusion—to create low-cost, reliable autonomous systems for use in disaster-stricken areas.

When I'm not working on engineering or school, I try helping out in my community where I can. A lot of my efforts go towards the refugee agency Ma'ruf in Dallas. There, I operate Project Taleem, a program to teach refugee students ages K-8 math and reading skills to help them reach their peers academically. Additionally, I enjoy playing tennis (though I'm not as good as I used to, what with school and everything).

I've also had the chance to talk with a lot of people through my robotics team, from the founder of Glorious to Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, where I was able to talk to him about my experience in FIRST and robotics in general, even providing him a demonstration of our robot!

Feel free to follow my GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn, and I'd love to talk more!
