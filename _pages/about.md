Hello reader, and welcome to my engineering portfolio! My name is Abdullah Khaled, and I am currently a junior at Wakeland High School in Frisco, TX. I enjoy both the hardware and software side of engineering and am always searching for ways to dive deeper into the field of engineering while helping others along the way. I am especially interested in robotics and am currently a software lead on my FIRSTÂ® Robotics (FRC) team Itkan Robotics!

When I'm not working on engineering, I can be found playing tennis with my friends or tutoring refugee students in math and reading at Ma'ruf Dallas. If you would like to contact me, please reach out via email at abdullahkhaled0224@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn!
