Welcome to my engineering portfolio! My name is Abdullah Khaled, and I am currently a junior at Wakeland High School in Frisco, TX. I enjoy both the hardware and software side of engineering and am always searching for ways to dive deeper into the field of engineering while helping others along the way. I am especially interested in robotics and how best to integrate the knowledge I have—from CAD to vision to sensor fusion—to create low-cost, reliable autonomous systems for use in disaster-stricken areas.

When I'm not working on engineering or school, I try helping out in my community where I can. A lot of my efforts go towards the refugee agency Ma'ruf in Dallas. There, I operate Project Taleem, a program to teach refugee students ages K-8 math and reading skills to help them reach their peers academically. Additionally, I enjoy playing tennis (though I'm not as good as I used to, what with school and everything).

If you'd like to talk with me, feel free to follow my GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn, and I'd love to talk more!
