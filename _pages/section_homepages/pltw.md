PTLW, or Project Lead The Way, is a non-profit organization aimed at giving students from elementary to high school an easily accessible way to explore career paths in STEM fields and learn real-world skills to excel in their future jobs. PTLW's core values are togetherness, inclusion, learning, and customer centricity, which create a caring and judgment-free environment for students to participate in hands-on learning without fear of failing in front of others. Below are some of my projects that I completed during my completion of the PLTW Engineering pathway:
